Do a Python simulation to find the optimal trimmed mean estimator of
the location of the Cauchy distribution, trying trimming proportions
of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 45%. Have the simulation use 100 samples of
1000 observations each. Use numpy if helpful. Use the print function to
display results, using to_string() for a pandas dataframe.
